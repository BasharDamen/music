				<h2> History of The Music </h2>
				<p class="article"> Music is found in every known society, past and present, and is considered to be a cultural universal. Since all
					people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music
					is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently,
					the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life,
					using various different materials to make various instruments.<br/>
						A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience,
						climate, access to technology and what religion is believed. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations
						in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions
						and periods. Music history is the distinct subfield of musicology and history which studies music (particularly Western
						art music) from a chronological perspective.

				<h2> How Music Affects The Brain </h2>
				<p class="article">
					Music improves brain health and function in many ways. It makes you smarter, happier, and more productive at any age. Listening
					is good, playing is better.<br>
          Music has played an important part in every human culture, both past and present.<br>
          People around the world respond to music in a universal way. (1) And now, advances in neuroscience enable researchers to measure just how music affects the brain.<br>
          The interest in the effects of music on the brain has led to a new branch of research called neuromusicology which explores how the nervous system reacts to music. And the evidence is in — music activates every known part of the brain. (2) Playing, and even just listening to, music can make you smarter, happier, healthier, and more productive at all stages of life.
